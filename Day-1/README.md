#System-health-check

The system-health-check script will check/analyse the following:
- The system health
- Check Disk Usage
- Monitor Running Services
- Assess Memory Usage
- Evaluate CPU Usage
- Send a Comprehensive Report via Email Every Four Hours

The script is user-friendly (accepting user inputs) and would also handle error gracefully.


##Importance
Understanding system health checks is crucial for maintaining high reliability and availability in any digital infrastructure. This challenge improved my scripting skills but also deepen my understanding of system monitoring, which is a key responsibility of DevOps/SREs.
